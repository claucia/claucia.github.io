I believe that learning by practicing is the best way to learn. With that in mind, I found an interesting way to get hands-on to real-world projects to acquire experience: [Frontend Mentor challenges][frontend-mentor-challenges].

This _FAQ accordion card_ was my first challenge. The goal was get it looking as close as possible to the design provided, keeping in mind that the users should be able to:

> - View the optimal layout for the component depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size.
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
> - Hide/show the answer to a question when the question gets clicked.  

The styles were written using SCSS. I reckon the font size is a bit too small, but I've attemted to follow the design as much as possible.

To bundle the application, I picked [Parcel.js][parcel-js]. It has plenty of default configurations, which made things a lot quicker to get up and running.

## Lessons learned

Here is what I learned (or what I want to remember on my next projects):

- `width: 100%`: the element is going to be 100% of the width of the parent container that got defined dimensions.

- `position: relative`: position an element _relatively_ to its normal position in the document flow. Then we can use `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to offset the element.

- `position: absolute`: the element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. And the funny thing that causes confusion: despite the name it's positioned _relatively_ to its closest positioned ancestor, if any exist. If none exist, it's positioned relatively to the document.

- To define the layout, I used Flexbox. And I would like to hightlight something nice I learned about it: When all children of a flexbox container have `flex-grow` set to `1`, then the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children.

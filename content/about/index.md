Hi there! My name is Cl√°ucia Cambruzzi and this is my humble website.

I am originally from Brazil, and I descend from an Italian family. Well, I reckon my name is not easy to pronounce, so you could simply call me _Nica_, which is my nickname. My family and close friends call me like that since I was a child :)

I moved to Ireland in mid-2018 and, since then I've been [working][cv] on hospitality, which was heavily affected by the COVID-19 restrictions. So, during a layoff from work, I started studying Web technologies such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. It's been a challenging and rewarding experience. I've been learning a lot on my own, and my [boyfriend][cassiomolin] helps me when I get stuck.

This website was created to show off my skills. Very soon there will be some content in the [portfolio] section!

I strongly believe that learning by practicing is the best way to learn. With that in mind, I found an interesting way to get some hands-on experience: [Frontend Mentor challenges][frontend-mentor-challenges]. There's a huge collection of challenges to choose from. Then I download the design files, and write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for bringing the design to life.

Ah! I am looking for a position as web developer. Please bear in mind I'm still learning, and I acknowledge I still have a lot to learn. Learning is a never-ending exercise, isn't it?

I surely don't have all the answers for the technical challenges I will face. But I'm surely focusing in asking the right questions (and they eventually help me to find the answers).

Finally, feel free to [reach out][contact] if you feel like doing so.

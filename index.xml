My name is Cláucia Cambruzzi and this is my website.
I am originally from Brazil, and I descend from an Italian family. Well, I reckon my name is not easy to pronounce, so you could simply call me Nica, which is my nickname. My family and close friends call me like that since I was a child :)
I moved to Ireland in mid-2018 and, since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on hospitality, which was heavily affected by the COVID-19 restrictions.</description></item><item><title>Cláucia Cambruzzi</title><link>https://claucia.com/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claucia.com/cv/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Get in touch</title><link>https://claucia.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claucia.com/contact/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
